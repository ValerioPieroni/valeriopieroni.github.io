Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona and Barcelona GSE. My supervisor is <a href="http://r-santaeulalia.net/" target="_blank">Raul Santaeulalia-Llopis</a>. 

My interests lie in the field of quantitative macroeconomics, with a focus on economic inequality, household heterogeneity, and monetary economics. I am also interested in econometrics and numerical methods.
