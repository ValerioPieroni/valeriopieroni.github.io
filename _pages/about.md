Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at <a href="http://idea.uab.es/" target="_blank">IDEA</a> from Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona and <a href="http://bse.eu/" target="_blank">Barcelona School of Economics</a>. My supervisor is <a href="http://r-santaeulalia.net/" target="_blank">Raul Santaeulalia-Llopis</a>. 

My research interests lie in the field of quantitative macroeconomics, with a focus on economic inequality, household heterogeneity, and monetary economics.
