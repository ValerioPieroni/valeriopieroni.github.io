<div style="text-align: justify">I study the effects of a reduction in energy supply using a quantitative Heterogeneous Agents
New Keynesian (HANK) model with energy consumption by households and firms. I find that
changes in aggregate demand due to an increase in energy prices and labor market adjustments
amplify the macroeconomic effects of the energy shock, but these effects remain manageable.
In the model a 10% reduction in the energy supply leads to a Gross National Income (GNI) loss
in range between 0.8% and 2%. The economic burden is highly nonlinear across the income
distribution: most households face similar and relatively contained costs, while low-income
households bear the heaviest burden. I show that monetary and fiscal policy can mitigate the
economic costs and the unequal effects of energy shortages.
