<div style="text-align: justify">How does wealth inequality shape the transmission of monetary policy to household consumption?
I quantitatively assess the contribution of different wealth groups to the response
of aggregate consumption, using the joint distribution of consumption, income, and wealth in
the US and a quantitative Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) model. I find that
households at the tails of the wealth distribution account for most of the aggregate consumption
dynamics. However, wealthy households in the top 10% have the largest impact on aggregate
consumption. The reason is that relative to other wealth groups, households at the top of the
distribution benefit the most from higher equity prices and have sizable consumption shares.
These effects also shape the transmission mechanism of monetary policy shocks. I show that
wealth dynamics due to asset price changes amplify the direct effects of monetary policy. Overall,
the findings in this paper provide new quantitative insights on the importance of the wealth
distribution and household heterogeneity for the aggregate effects of macroeconomic shocks.

Conditionally Accepted, <em>European Economic Review</em> 
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify">I study the effects of a reduction in energy supply using a quantitative Heterogeneous Agents
New Keynesian (HANK) model with energy consumption by households and firms. I find that
changes in aggregate demand due to an increase in energy prices and labor market adjustments
amplify the macroeconomic effects of the energy shock, but these effects remain manageable.
In the model a 10% reduction in the energy supply leads to a Gross National Income (GNI) loss
in range between 0.8% and 2%. The economic burden is highly nonlinear across the income
distribution: most households face similar and relatively contained costs, while low-income
households bear the heaviest burden. I show that monetary and fiscal policy can mitigate the
economic costs and the unequal effects of energy shortages.
