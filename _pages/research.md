**"Wealth Inequality and the Heterogeneous Effects of Monetary Policy"**<br> 
 <br>   
  
How does the high concentration of wealth shape the transmission of monetary policy to
household consumption? I study this question in a quantitative Heterogeneous Agent New
Keynesian (HANK) model. The model reproduces the distribution of income and wealth in the
United States, and generates empirically realistic consumption responses to stimulus policies. I
find that top wealth groups substantially amplify the interest income channel of monetary policy
and increase the persistence of the labor income channel. The reason is that households at the
top of the wealth distribution show large responses to monetary policy shocks and have sizable
consumption shares. In the model, wealthy households are more responsive due to differences
in the income composition and consumption-saving behavior across wealth groups. The analysis
sheds new light on the importance of wealth concentration and heterogeneous responses for
the aggregate effects of monetary policy shocks.
